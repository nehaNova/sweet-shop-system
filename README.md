## 🧪 Test‑Driven Development (TDD)

The backend follows **Test‑Driven Development (TDD)** principles.  
Tests were written using **Jest** and **Supertest** to validate API behavior.

The development process followed the **Red–Green–Refactor** cycle:

- **Red** – Wrote failing tests for backend API endpoints  
- **Green** – Implemented backend logic to satisfy the tests  
- **Refactor** – Cleaned and stabilized code while keeping tests passing  

This approach helped identify backend–frontend contract issues early and ensured reliable API behavior.
